pm : lightweight, simple password manager.

Usage: pm [verb] [NAME] [options]

Verbs:
    set : Make a new entry with the given name. You will then be prompted for
        the secret key, and the text to store.

        get : Retrieve a stored password under the given name. The secret key
        is required to retrieve the password.

    forg : (forget) Mark the named entry as forgotten. The password hash WILL NOT
        be deleted. The entry must be remembered for the password to be retrieved
        again.

    rem : (remember) Find the forgotten entry by the given name and return it to
        normal status so it may be retrieved.

    del : (delete) Remove the named entry from the database. Cannot be undone.

    loc : (locate) Prints a list of entries which match the given expression.

Options: By default, the retrieved password is written to the clipboard, where it
    will remain for CLIPCOOLDOWN seconds. After the interval, the clipboard is rewritten
    with its previous contents. Pm remembers if it has written multiple passwords,
    and will clear all of them at the end of the interval.*

    -e : Echo the retrieved password to stdout. Not recommended.

    -noval : Do not store hash - pm will be unable to check the password for validity
        on future retrieval.

    -v : Set the target vault. If not specified, the default from pm.conf is targeted.

    -db : Set the target database. As with vault, the defualt will be used if not specified.


Configuration:*

In .pm.conf :

MASTERMODE=1 # By default, the same secret key must be used to encrypt all stored passwords
CACHEKEY=0   # Number of seconds for which the secret key will remain in memory,
                    # allowing the user to retrieve further keys without re-entering
                    # the secret key.
CLIPCOOLDOWN=120 # Number of seconds that retrieved passwords will remain in the clipboard
                        # until the clipboard is restored. A value of 0 means
                        # the clipboard will not be restored.
