Verbs:
    set : Make a new entry with the given name. You will then be prompted for
        the secret key, and the text to store.

    get : Retrieve a stored password under the given name. The secret key
        is required to retrieve the password.

    forg : (forget) Mark the named entry as forgotten. The password hash WILL NOT
        be deleted. The entry must be remembered for the password to be retrieved
        again.

    rec : (recover) Mark the given entry as 'clear', so it may be retrieved.

    del : (delete) Remove the named entry from the database. Cannot be undone.

Options: By default, the retrieved password is written to the clipboard, where it
    will remain for CLIPCOOLDOWN seconds. After the interval, the clipboard is rewritten
    with its previous contents. Pm remembers if it has written multiple passwords,
    and will clear all of them at the end of the interval.*

    -u (unique key) : Specifies that the vault to be operated on is unique key, 
        not (necessarily) sharing the same secret key among all entries.

        on future retrieval.
