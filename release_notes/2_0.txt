PM Alpha .20

Added new invocation protocol, including a configuration file. Now, pm is called
    via a shell script which passes the path to a .conf file to pm.c:main. The
    path to pm's underlying database is contained in the .conf, which also includes
    options which customize encryption and user interface.
