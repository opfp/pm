PM Alpha .30

PM Alpha .3 adds multiple vaults with two encryption settings, common key,
    (commkey) and unique key (ukey). With this comes three new commands, ls-vaults
    to list vaults, mkvault to create vaults, and delvault to delete. The -u flag
    is used to access and work with ukey vaults, however it is not required when
    acessing user defined vaults which are unique key.
