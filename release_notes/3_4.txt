Pm Alpha .34

PM alpha .34 fully implements the pm .30 spec, but with different vault names.
    mkvault and rmvault remain the same, but loc and ls-vaults have been renamed
    and reworked as ls and lsv. ls is for listing and searching for entries, while
    lsv is the same for vaults. When lsv locates a vault, it also prints the contents
    of the vault.
